## ---Goal
The Goal was to improve the code to be easier to read and modify, making it more modular and clean.

## ---Real progress
The file withdraw was the my first target but could only refactor about 40%, when came the db cb hell I realised that was going to need to refactor the database file if I wanted to finish the withdraw file but unfortunatly I don't have more time for this challenge becouse of my work :(
